                            <p>During the end of my time at the Digital Futures Academy, we were tasked with a capstone project.
                                This project was to create a data analysis dashboard using a dataset of our choice and present this, which would allow me to showcase
                                my Python, ETL, and Data Engineering skills.
                                I decided to create an analysis dashboard for spotify, using data retrieved from the 
                                <a href = "https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api" target="_blank">Spotify Web API</a> 
                            </p>
                            <p>The links to the dashboard and the code are below:</p>
                            <li><a href = "https://hamza-capstone-project.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Streamlit App</a>
                                (You may need to "wake up" the website as streamlit sends it to sleep if it hasn't been accessed in a while).</li>
                            <li><a href = "https://github.com/HamzaKho/capstone_project" target="_blank">ETL GitHub Repo</a></li>
                            <li><a href = "https://github.com/HamzaKho/capstone_project_streamlit" target="_blank">Streamlit GitHub Repo</a></li>
                            
                            <p>I created the dashboard using 
                                <a href = "https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> 
                                 which allowed me to create interactive visualisations and publish them using only python code. 
                            </p>
                            <p>This is was useful as it allowed me to use the ETL skills I learnt during my time at the Digital Futures Academy as a Data Engineer.
                            </p>
                            <h2>How I created it:</h2>
                            <li>Extract: I used the Spotify Web API to extract the data I needed into a pandas dataframe.</li>
                            <li>Transform: Using pandas, I transformed the data in various ways, for example by cleaning up song names (like removing features from titles), and adding columns
                                such as region, and features. These transformations allow me to perform the analysis I wanted to, and keep the data clean.
                            </li>
                            <li>Load: I loaded the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database, which is hosted on AWS. I made sure that when loading the data, only new 
                                updates were added/removed from the table, to reduce the load on the database and prevent data duplication.</li>
                            <li>The entire ETL process was on a "cron job", meaning it was ran automatically daily, to gather the data over a larger period of time.</li>
                            <li>Analysis: I used various python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create interactive visualisations of the data
                                to support the narrative I wanted to tell. This was done in a Streamlit app, which allowed me to create a website, using Python alone.
                                I connected to the database and extracted the data, which was then used to create the visualisations.</li>
                            </li>
                            <h2>Results</h2>
                            <p>The streamlit app can be accessed 
                                <a href = "https://hamza-capstone-project.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">here</a>
                                (You may need to "wake up" the website as streamlit sends it to sleep if it hasn't been accessed in a while).</p>
                            </p>
                            <p>Although I was able to successfully create an ETL pipeline and extract some insights from Spotify's API successfully,
                                there are was still area for improvement.
                            </p>
                            <li>Unfortunately I was not able to set out my goal of doing a full global analysis of every country/region. This is due to Spotify's
                                Web API updating and deprecating alot of features, but the relevant documentation had not been updated at the time of the project.
                                In future I should be sure to research the API more thoroughly, and use quick jupyter notebooks to ensure all endpoints that are necessary are
                                 still available.
                            </li>
                            <li>Although my visualisations are interactive, and the website is responsive, it retrieves data from the database repeatedly every time the user
                                clicks on something, which makes the website feel slow. This wasn't an issue during testing, as streamlit only acts like this once the app is deployed.
                                In the future I could study the Streamlit documentation to change this behaviour, as it would significantly improve the responsiveness of my site.
                            </li>
                            <p>Despite these shortcomings and areas for future work, my project was still successful in delivering the rest of the requirements I set out
                                in my <a href="https://github.com/HamzaKho/capstone_project/blob/main/project-plan.md" target="_blank">project plan.</a>
